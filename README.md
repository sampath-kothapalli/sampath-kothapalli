      <h1>Hi! I'm Sampath Kumar 👋</h1>
      <p>
        I’m an experienced <strong>Data Analyst at Bidgely</strong>, working at the intersection of 
        <strong>energy, analytics, and AI</strong> to transform complex energy consumption data into 
        <strong>actionable insights</strong>. At Bidgely, I leverage tools like <strong>SQL, Python, and Tableau</strong> 
        to analyze large-scale datasets, evaluate usage patterns, track program performance, and support 
        <strong>data-driven decision-making</strong> for utility companies optimizing their energy efficiency programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work focuses on turning raw data into clear, compelling stories that drive business outcomes. 
        I have hands-on experience in <strong>exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation, CLV modeling, and statistical testing</strong>, 
        with a track record of delivering insights that shape strategy and innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Passionate about solving real-world problems through data, I thrive in environments where analytics fuel 
        smarter decisions and measurable impact.
